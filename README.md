# Data Analysis & Visualization Project For Eniac:
## Objective: 
To find that Magist is the best service provider for Eniac's order deliveries or not.

## Summary:
As a part of **WBS Coding School** learning exercise we got our first project which allows us to showcase our knowledge gained till now from Bootcamp.

Details of this project are as follows:

**Eniac** is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories in Spain & exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market. So,Here comes **Magist** a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces.
**Eniac** has two main concerns:
1. Magist is a good partner for these high-end tech products.
2. Are deliveries fast enough?

So, to guide **Eniac** with these 2 aspects, we have gathered some data from Magist & showcased the insights which will be helpful for Eniac to decide.

## Tools Used:
1. MySQL for extracting the data.
2. Tableau for visualizing that data.
3. Google Slides to present & summarize the data with conclusion.
   
## Datasource:
We have used Magist's database to extract the exact data & visualize it to summarize.

## Project Contributors:
Group of 4 peoples contributed in this project work.

## Key Learnings:
1. Explored the Magist's database in MySQL by reverse engineering & EER diagram.
2. Explored the tables using sql queries & find out the answers for business questions which includes products,sellers & delivery time parameters.
3. Published the above findings to Tableau to create visualizations in different types of bar charts.
4. Analyzed the data through the graphs & discussed within group members with which data we will move forward to conclusion.
5. At the end together with group members prepared a presentation.

## Challenges Overcame:
The main challenge was, which query results should be considered & another one was how to extract those results to Tableau for visualizations. But when 4 data analyst works together then nothing will be impossible so, we have divided our work among all of us & created different visualizations per parameters.Meanwhile helped each other if at any time problem occurs. Finally, we got our inputs & then prepared a presentation. 

## Conclusion:
We have concluded our presentation as:

1.Magist is not a seller specialized in technology, as less than 20% of the total products are tech products, and most are considered cheap.
2.Magist is great at delivering their products on time and has fantastic customer happiness.

**We would recommend comparing Magist with a company that specializes in high-end tech products and see how their delivery and customer happiness compare to Magist.**
